# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project aims to analyze customer churn behavior using a dataset from a bank. It applies data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning classification models to predict the likelihood of customer churn.

## 🧠 Objective
- Understand the key factors leading to customer churn  
- Build predictive models to classify churners vs non-churners  
- Evaluate model performance and suggest retention strategies  

---

## 📉 Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle or internal source]  
- **Size**: 10,000+ customer records  
- **Features**: Geography, Credit Score, Gender, Tenure, Balance, etc.  
- **Target**: `Exited` (0 = Churn, 1 = No Churn)  

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis
Performed detailed visualizations and statistics to:
- Understand distribution of key variables  
- Detect outliers and missing values  
- Identify correlations with churn  

---

## 🛠️ Models Used
- Logistic Regression  


## Evaluated using:
- Accuracy  
- Precision, Recall, F1-score  
- Confusion Matrix  
- ROC-AUC  

---

## ✅ Results
- **Best Model**: [Logistic Regression]  
- **Accuracy**: 81%    
- **Top Features**: `CreditScore`, `Balance`, `Geography`, etc.
